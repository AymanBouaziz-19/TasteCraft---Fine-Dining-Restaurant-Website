# TasteCraft â€“ Fine Dining Restaurant Website

> **Personal project built with React + TypeScript to showcase full-stack development skills for luxury restaurants and hospitality brands.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

TasteCraft is a fictional restaurant website designed to demonstrate how a modern, elegant, and responsive online presence can enhance a high-end restaurantâ€™s brand identity and drive more reservations.

This project was developed as part of my portfolio to attract potential clients in the restaurant & hospitality industry, especially those in Europe and the U.S.

## âœ¨ Features

- Elegant landing page with hero image and scroll animations
- Online menu (HTML + downloadable PDF)
- Fully responsive and mobile-first layout
- Reservation form with form validation and email integration
- Embedded Google Maps location
- WhatsApp quick booking button
- Clean typography and color palette
- Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- Dark mode toggle (optional)

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- EmailJS (for form)
- Firebase (optional backend)
- Vite (build tool)
- Deployed on Vercel

## ðŸ”¥ Why this project?

Many restaurants either lack a website or use outdated templates. This project proves how a polished, fast, and elegant website can immediately improve their digital presence and build customer trust â€” especially for luxury restaurants.

## ðŸ§  What I learned

- Advanced component structure in React + TypeScript
- UI/UX principles for high-conversion pages
- Tailwind customization for branding
- Animations with Framer Motion
- Real-world deployment with Vite & Vercel
